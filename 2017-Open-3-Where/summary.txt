This problem has a very small contraint, and so then we think of brute force. However it might be hard to believe that ther are still complete brute force problems in silver. This is one example. We can look through all the possible subrectangles and check to see if they are a plc (it can't be contained by a plc we already found). If they are a plc, then we check if the other plcs are subrectangles of this plc, hence removing them. The idea might be straight forward, but the coding is pretty tedious.
