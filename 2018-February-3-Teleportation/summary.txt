For this problem the algorithm was trying to find how much each point on the number line
saves you time. To do that, we need to split the start and destination into different 
cases and then figuring out where the triangle of values is. Then we can record the slopes 
of those triangles and use them to help figure out what is the max of the whole thing. 

While I was doing this problem I made many mistakes. I forgot to add up the change in y, 
and I instead just used that to compare with the max value. I also made a small mistake by
accidentally writing || as &&, which made me really confused.
