for this problem, we note that the first column is useless, because it's always going to be zero no matter what. However, the second column gives us the most information, because it's telling us the difference between two numbers. Furthermore, we can observe that the numbers can never just represent one solution, we can always add the same thing to all the numbers and get another solution. This also means that only the difference between the numbers matter. Using this information, we can then fix the last number in our array as x, or as any number like zero. We then can use the second column to figure out the possibilities of the other numbers. But this is still not the solution to this problem, beacuse of the exponential growth of the possibilities. To fix this, we will need to use the other numbers given. We will need to use those other numbers to check if the current possibility work. We can just cycle through and record the largest and minimum numbers for that. That will give us a fixed number every time. 

During the contest, I didn't really got to this problem, because I didn't have time. But after the contest, I still wasn't sure about this problem because it just seemed like there are too many ways to approach this and will require solving equations and things related to math.
