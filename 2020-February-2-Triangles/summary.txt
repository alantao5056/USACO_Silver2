While coming up with the solution of this problem, it might seem that every one of the solutions would 
time out. However, with a few observations we can solve this problem easily. First of all, two times
the area of the triangle is basically the sides parallel to the x and y axis. Secondly, if we fix one 
point, we can use the other points with the same x and y as the fixed point, to make different 
triangles with the right angle on the fixed point. But in order to do this for every point, it would 
definetly time out. The only solution is to sort the points by x, then looking at all the points that 
has the same x, and calculating each of their total x sum in O(1) time. The total x sum is the sum of 
all the segments connecting a point to every other point with the same x. We can do the same with y, 
and multiply the x and y together to get the total area of the triangles formed with the right angle 
on this point.
