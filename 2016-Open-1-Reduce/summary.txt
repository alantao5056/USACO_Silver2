this problem might seem simple at first, but it gets complicated because of the variety of possibilities of the points we can remove. This can drive people in the wrong direction and complicate the problem. The solution is to first observe the possible minX, maxX, minY and maxY. For these four sides, the only possibilites are staying the same, removing the largest, removing the second largest and removing the third largest. We would then get 4 different possibilities for each side, and 4^4 is 256. We can iterate through all the possibilites, while iterating through all the points to see how many points are not in the rectangle to determine our answer.
